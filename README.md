# Structure Of Social Psychology
An investigation into the structure of scholarship in social/personality psychology using the network structure of shared citations (bibliometric couplings), whole text analyses, and other methods.

Based partially on earlier analyses presented at the following conferences:

## Presentations
1) American Psychological Society (San Francisco, 2014)

* http://www.slideshare.net/lanningk/network-analyses-of-psych-science
* Initial analyses of personality chapters in *Annual Review of Psychology*, network based on names

2) Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (Portland, 2014)

* http://www.slideshare.net/lanningk/network-analyses-of-spssi
* Analyses of two SPSSI journals, network based on names 

3) Social Psychology Winter Conference (Park City, 2015),

* http://www.slideshare.net/lanningk/structure-of-social-psych-lanning-social-psych-winter-conf-2015
* Analyses of *JPSP* sections in 2014, network based on DOI
* Explicit reduction of two-mode network to a single mode

4) Dynamical Systems and Computational Modeling: Social Dynamics in a Changing World Preconference (Long Beach, February 2015)

* http://www.slideshare.net/lanningk/structure-of-social-psychology-spsp
* Added analyses of *JPSP* 1994, 1999, 2004, 2009

5)  International Convention of Psychological Science (ICPS), Amsterdam, March 12-14 2015

* http://www.slideshare.net/lanningk/lanning-icps-2015-130x90cm
* For 2014 data, interpretation of community structure based upon analyses of whole texts

## Current status

6) The structure of analyses in the ICPS paper will be extended to additional journals to provide a more comprehensive snapshot of the field.  I am adding three other prominent articles with (personality and social) in the journal title

* *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin* 
* *Personality and Social Psychology Review* 
* *Social Psychological and Personality Science*

I expect that an analysis of these four journals (including *JPSP*) will be submitted for publication in the Spring or Summer of 2015. 

7) Ideally, one would include the following dozen additional journals in social *or* (as opposed to *and*) personality psychology, namely:

* *Journal of Personality*
* *Journal of Research in Personality*
* *European Journal of Social Psych*
* *European Review of Social Psych* 
* *European Monographs in Social Psychology* 
* *European Journal of Personality* 
* *Personality and Individual Differences* 
* *Advances in Experimental Social Psychology*
* *Journal of Experimental Social Psychology* 
* *Personal Relationships* 
* *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*
* *Self and Identity*
